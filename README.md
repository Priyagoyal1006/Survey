# Survey
Mental Health Condition Prediction
This project predicts mental health conditions based on user input symptoms using machine learning models.

Dataset Preprocessing
Missing Values: Handled via imputation.
Normalization: Scaled numerical features.
Encoding: Categorical data encoded into numeric form.
Feature Engineering: Created meaningful input features.
Feature Selection: Retained the most impactful features.
Model Selection Rationale
Random Forest: Chosen for its robustness and interpretability.
XGBoost: Considered for high performance and speed.
Logistic Regression: Simple and effective for binary classification.
Neural networks: for those complex relationships in the model; Random forest chose because of it's high accuracies and efficiency.
CLI
Run the script in the command line to predict the mental health condition based on symptom inputs.
